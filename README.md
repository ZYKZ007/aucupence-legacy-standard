# Aucupence Legacy Standard – Presales, Governance & Enablement Asset Library

Status: Archived snapshot. This repository represents a legacy internal baseline used for structured presales and delivery governance support.

Aucupence works as a behind-the-scenes consulting partner for software vendors and outsourcing teams facing global client standards. The assets here illustrate how a small specialist team translates engineering capability into review-ready proposal material for regulated and high-expectation environments.

This library is routinely referenced in three engagement types:
- Vendor-side presales and RFP response support for fintech, payments, and public-sector programs.
- Delivery governance and quality design for offshore / nearshore operating models.
- Enablement and coaching for project managers and tech leads who must explain delivery, risk, and architecture in English.

No client-identifying information is included. Examples are intentionally generalized and can be safely used as baseline patterns.
