# Aucupence Legacy Standard – Presales, Governance & Enablement Asset Library

Status: Archived snapshot. This repository represents a legacy internal baseline used for:
- Presales support for software vendors and outsourcing teams,
- Proposal and RFP response work,
- Delivery governance design,
- Enablement and coaching of project managers and tech leads.

It is not a finished “product” or a methodology book. It is a curated slice of the internal working material that a small consulting team used while helping vendors:
- Respond to complex RFPs in regulated industries (banking, payments, public sector),
- Explain non-functional architecture choices to demanding technical reviewers,
- Defend estimates, commercials and delivery models in steering committees,
- Train PMs and tech leads to talk about risk, scope and resilience in clear English.

The assets are intentionally abstracted and anonymised. They are detailed enough to show how we think, structure and communicate, but they do not expose client-identifying information or full proprietary playbooks.

## Structure

1. 01-rfp-decomposition  
   Compliance matrices, regulatory checklists, bid / no-bid criteria and risk narratives that show how a complex RFP is unpacked into manageable workstreams and decision points.

2. 02-technical-proposal-kit  
   Standard non-functional requirement (NFR) responses, solution-architecture notes and reference patterns for digital lending and other transaction-heavy systems, including performance, security and resilience baselines.

3. 03-scope-estimation-commercial  
   Effort-estimation models, role-mix descriptions, rate-card structures and commercial-defense language tailored to offshore / nearshore delivery setups.

4. 04-plan-level-delivery-governance  
   Delivery-governance models, phase plans, milestone and gate definitions, steering-committee structures and a redacted retrospective from a digital-lending programme.

5. 05-quality-and-test-strategy  
   Test strategies, QA governance, CI/CD quality gates, defect SLAs and reporting baselines that can be plugged into regulated-client environments.

6. 06-defense-and-qa-library  
   Presales technical and commercial Q&A narratives, plus enablement topics for PMs and tech leads who need to defend their projects and commercials to international clients.

7. api-specs, diagrams, docs, infrastructure  
   Lightweight placeholders for API contracts, architecture decisions and infrastructure-as-code, used to signal how proposal material, architecture documentation and Terraform-based environments tie together.

## Intended Use

This repository is kept as a reference library to:
- Demonstrate the style and depth of presales and governance work Aucupence performed,
- Provide examples for training and coaching sessions,
- Act as a starting point when assembling new proposal and governance packs.

Real engagements extend these baselines with client-specific diagrams, numbers, financials and runbooks that are not included here for confidentiality. The intent is to show capability and structure, not to publish a complete solution.
