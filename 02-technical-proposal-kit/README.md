# Technical Proposal Kit (Legacy Baseline)

This module contains proposal-ready technical narrative baselines used to help vendors respond to regulated or transaction-heavy digital programs without exposing client-specific architecture.

The intent is to demonstrate a credible, review-friendly structure for:
- Architecture overview sections
- NFR responses for cloud-hosted platforms
- Security-by-design statements aligned with audit expectations
- Integration patterns common in digital banking, lending and payments
- Operability and Day-2 readiness signals

This is a legacy reference library:
- Abstract enough for safe reuse
- Specific enough to sound real in technical evaluation
- Designed to be paired with RFP triage, estimation and governance modules
