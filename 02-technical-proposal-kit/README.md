# Module 02 – Technical Proposal Kit

This module is a proposal-stage reference baseline for cloud-hosted digital banking, lending and transaction-heavy platforms.

It is designed to help vendors and delivery teams produce:
- Scorable, audit-friendly NFR responses.
- A consistent multi-view architecture narrative (logical, integration, data, security, operability).
- Clear assumptions and constraints that protect both client and vendor during early-stage procurement.
- Enough technical depth to satisfy architecture panels without disclosing client-specific IP.
