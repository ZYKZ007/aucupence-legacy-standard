# Commercial Model and Ratecard Guide

This document explains how we structure rates and commercial models so that they reflect real delivery effort and risk, not just a list of numbers.

## 1. Ratecard Structure

We typically define:

- Role-based rates per location (onshore, nearshore, offshore),
- A small number of blended rates for high-level budgeting,
- Rules for when each rate or blend applies.

Example role categories:

- Engagement Director / Engagement Manager
- Solution Architect / Lead Engineer
- Project Manager / Scrum Master
- Senior Developer / Engineer
- Mid-level Developer / Engineer
- QA Engineer / Test Automation
- DevOps / SRE

We avoid excessive granularity that makes invoicing and tracking complex but keep enough structure for governance and audit.

## 2. Blended Rates

Blended rates are useful for:

- Early budgeting,
- Steering-committee level reporting,
- High-level cost comparisons.

They are derived from the underlying role mix, not invented independently. During negotiations we are transparent about:

- The typical team composition assumed,
- The ratio of senior to mid-level roles,
- The footprint across locations.

## 3. Indexation and Currency

For multi-year engagements we address:

- Currency risk (when billing and cost bases are different),
- Inflation and indexation (for example annual adjustments linked to an index or fixed percentage),
- FX assumptions when part of the team is paid in a different currency.

We prefer to:

- Define a base currency for the contract,
- Agree adjustment mechanisms up front,
- Avoid re-negotiating fundamentals each year.

## 4. Linking Rates to Quality and Governance

We explain how rates include more than “coding time”:

- Architecture and design time,
- QA and automation effort,
- Governance, reporting and steering preparation.

This avoids later discussions where governance or quality work is seen as “extra” and not budgeted for.

---

## 5. Commercial Boundaries

We document our commercial red lines:

- No unlimited liability for indirect or consequential loss,
- No “all inclusive” fixed price on large, evolving scope without discovery,
- Clear caps on penalties and service credits,
- Defined rules for travel and expenses.

These boundaries are important to keep delivery sustainable and to avoid incentives that would push towards shortcuts in quality or risk management.
