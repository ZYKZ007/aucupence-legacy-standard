# Presales Commercial & Scope Q&A – Standard Library

This library is used when procurement or senior stakeholders challenge the commercial model, pricing level or scope discipline.

## 1. Scope and Change Control

Question: Why do you insist on a formal change-control process?

Answer:  
Complex digital projects evolve over time. Without a clear mechanism to manage changes, both parties risk misaligned expectations and hidden costs. A structured change process protects the customer and the vendor by making the impact of each change visible and agreed:

- We document the requested change in simple language,
- We assess impact on effort, timeline and risk,
- We present options (do now, defer, or decline),
- We only proceed once the option and impact are approved.

This avoids “silent” scope creep and keeps the commercial model transparent to governance and audit.

## 2. Fixed Price vs Time and Materials

Question: Can you deliver this entire scope on a fixed price?

Answer:  
Fixed price is feasible when requirements are stable and clearly defined. When key assumptions are still open, we normally propose:

1. A discovery phase on Time and Materials to converge on a baseline (requirements, architecture, NFRs, interfaces).  
2. After discovery, we convert well-understood workstreams into fixed price with:
   - Clear acceptance criteria,
   - Explicit assumptions and exclusions,
   - Defined change-control rules.

This creates a mixed model: fixed price where risk is manageable, Time and Materials where scope is still moving or heavily dependent on third parties.

## 3. “Your Rates Look High”

Question: Your rates seem higher than some competitors. Why?

Answer:  
We typically explain three levers:

- Productivity and composition of the team – we use a smaller, more senior core with clear ownership, supported by standardised tooling and automation.  
- Embedded governance and quality – our commercial model already includes architecture, QA and delivery-governance effort; they are not optional extras.  
- Risk profile – we price to deliver reliably in a regulated environment rather than to win only on headline rate.

Where useful, we compare scenario totals (for example cost to reach a credible go-live) instead of isolated day rates.

## 4. Blended Rates vs Role-Based Rates

Question: Can you give us a single blended rate instead of a detailed rate card?

Answer:  
For planning purposes we often provide a high-level blended rate. However, for governance and transparency we keep the underlying role-based rate card:

- The blended rate is useful for high-level budgeting and benchmarking,  
- The role-based view is needed for audits, unit-rate comparisons and change requests.

We are happy to work with either format, as long as the underlying structure and assumptions remain traceable.

## 5. Budget Pressure and Trade-offs

Question: If our budget is lower than your proposal, what can we do?

Answer:  
Instead of simply cutting rates, we normally explore:

- Scope trade-offs – remove or de-scope lower-value features, or move them to a later phase.  
- Non-functional adjustments – adjust some NFR targets where they drive disproportionate cost, while staying within regulatory and business constraints.  
- Delivery-model changes – modify onshore / offshore mix or cadence, without compromising key governance roles.

This makes it explicit what changes when budget changes, so that executives understand the trade-offs instead of assuming “same scope for less”.

## 6. Overruns and Accountability

Question: What happens if you overrun the agreed effort?

Answer:  
We separate estimation error from client-driven change:

- If the work is within agreed scope and the overrun is due to our underestimation, we expect to absorb some or all of that impact.  
- If the overrun is driven by new requirements, third-party delays or scope changes, we expect that to be visible in the change-control log and reflected in commercials.

This principle is discussed up front so that, when issues occur, both sides can refer back to a shared understanding rather than renegotiating basics under pressure.

## 7. Currency and FX Risk

Question: How do you handle currency and FX risk in a multi-year contract?

Answer:  
We prefer to:

- Define a base currency for the contract,  
- Agree rules for how FX movements are handled (for example thresholds, review points, or indexation),  
- Keep the mechanism simple enough that both finance teams can operate it without constant negotiation.

If part of the delivery team is paid in a different currency, we explain how that is reflected in our pricing and risk assumptions.

## 8. Long-Term Cost of Ownership

Question: How do we know that your model does not create hidden long-term costs?

Answer:  
We explicitly discuss:

- Separation of build and run costs,  
- The impact of NFRs on infrastructure and licence spend,  
- How automation and quality practices reduce operational incidents and rework.

Where appropriate, we provide rough TCO scenarios so that steering committees can compare not just initial build cost, but total cost over a sensible horizon.
