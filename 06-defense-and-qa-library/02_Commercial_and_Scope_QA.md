# Presales Commercial & Scope Q&A – Standard Library

This library supports bid defense, negotiation workshops and steering-committee discussions.

## 1. Scope and Change Control

**Q1. Why do you insist on formal change control?**  
A1. Complex programs evolve. A structured change process protects both sides by making impact explicit and agreed before execution.

**Q2. What counts as a change vs. clarification?**  
A2. Clarifications resolve ambiguity within the original baseline. Changes introduce new journeys, integrations, NFR levels or acceptance criteria.

**Q3. How do you quantify change impact quickly?**  
A3. We use a lightweight impact template covering effort delta, schedule impact, risk posture and dependency constraints.

## 2. Fixed Price vs. Time & Materials

**Q4. Can you deliver the full scope on fixed price?**  
A4. Fixed price is viable when requirements and dependencies are stable. We often propose Discovery on T&M, then convert clearly defined workstreams to fixed price with explicit assumptions.

**Q5. Why split Discovery from Build commercially?**  
A5. It reduces estimation risk and creates a shared baseline for both scope and NFRs, preventing hidden rework costs later.

## 3. Pricing Drivers

**Q6. What makes your price move the most?**  
A6. Integration count/quality, regulatory constraints, data-migration complexity and availability requirements are the dominant drivers.

**Q7. How do NFRs affect commercials?**  
A7. Higher availability, lower latency and stricter auditability typically increase architecture, testing and infrastructure cost. We surface these trade-offs early for conscious decisions.

## 4. Risk Allocation

**Q8. How do you separate estimation error from client-driven change?**  
A8. We absorb true internal underestimation within baseline scope. Client-driven expansions, dependency delays or new compliance targets are governed through the CR log.

**Q9. How do you price uncertain integrations?**  
A9. We define integration assumptions and, where needed, isolate high-risk interfaces as capped T&M components.

## 5. TCO and Run Costs

**Q10. Do you address run cost in proposals?**  
A10. Yes. We provide rough build-vs-run framing, show how automation lowers incident rates, and outline optional optimization phases post go-live.

**Q11. How do you avoid “cheap build, expensive run”?**  
A11. We align architecture, observability and test automation with operational KPIs and include these as deliverables, not optional nice-to-haves.
