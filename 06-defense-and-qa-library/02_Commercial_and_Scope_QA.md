# Commercial & Scope Q&A (18)

## Q1. Why do you insist on a written scope baseline?
A baseline prevents silent scope creep and enables measurable progress. It aligns governance, budget and delivery targets. Without it, neither velocity nor cost is defensible.

## Q2. Can you deliver fully fixed price?
Yes, when requirements, interfaces and NFRs are stable and acceptance criteria are explicit. We typically run discovery first to converge on a realistic baseline. Mixed models are common for risk-balanced delivery.

## Q3. How do you manage change requests?
Changes are logged, estimated and impact-scored before implementation. Options are presented: accept with cost/time, defer, or de-scope. This protects both parties from hidden commitments.

## Q4. Why charge for discovery?
Discovery is the work that prevents guess-based pricing. It clarifies interfaces, data, NFRs and governance assumptions. It reduces downstream rework and negotiation friction.

## Q5. How do you defend your rate card?
Rates reflect skill mix, governance overhead and regulatory workload. We compare total cost-to-deliver, not isolated day rates. Quality and risk posture are priced transparently.

## Q6. What drives estimate variance most?
Integration uncertainty, data readiness and regulatory review cycles. Third-party dependency volatility is a frequent driver. We document assumptions to make variance traceable.

## Q7. Who owns environment costs?
We support both models. If vendor-hosted, we provide consumption visibility and guardrails. If client-hosted, we rely on agreed provisioning SLAs.

## Q8. How do you handle late client inputs?
We track client dependencies explicitly in RAID logs. Delays pause relevant delivery clocks according to the agreed governance rules. Impact is surfaced early to steering cadence.

## Q9. How do you address scope ambiguity in RFPs?
We list clarifications and assumptions in the proposal. Ambiguous items are priced with ranges or placed in a discovery bucket. We avoid pretending uncertainty does not exist.

## Q10. What if internal estimation was wrong?
We separate estimation error from client-driven change. If scope is unchanged, we absorb impact proportionally as agreed. This principle is stated up front to protect trust.

## Q11. Can you support capacity-based commercials?
Yes for long-running programs with stable backlog flow. Capacity models simplify monthly forecasting. Governance focuses on throughput and outcome tracking.

## Q12. Do you offer outcome-based pricing?
Only where metrics are measurable and jointly controllable. We define data sources and attribution rules early. Governance remains strong to avoid KPI gaming.

## Q13. How do you manage liability expectations?
We align risk allocation with industry norms. Caps and exclusions are structured to remain commercially sustainable. Security obligations are matched with realistic responsibilities.

## Q14. How do you handle IP ownership?
Client owns deliverables specific to the engagement. Vendor retains reusable accelerators unless exclusivity is purchased. This is clarified in the SOW.

## Q15. How do you support transition and exit?
We define exit artefacts, KT sessions and documentation deliverables. Handover activities are scheduled within the plan. This reduces operational risk and lock-in perception.

## Q16. How do you handle multi-vendor environments?
We define interface ownership and RACI early. Integration governance is formalized with joint technical forums. Cross-vendor SLAs and escalation are documented.

## Q17. What is your approach to contract renewals?
We review performance, scope drift and NFR shifts. Rate adjustments, if any, follow pre-agreed indexation rules. We keep renewal negotiation evidence-based.

## Q18. How do you respond to budget reduction requests?
We propose trade-offs: scope reduction, phased releases or NFR adjustments where permissible. We avoid reducing quality and governance below safe thresholds. Decisions are documented for auditability.
