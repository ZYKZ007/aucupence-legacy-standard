# PM Enablement Q&A (12)

## Q1. How should PMs explain the delivery model to international clients?
Start with accountability and role clarity. Explain onshore decision authority and offshore execution scope. Use a simple RACI and time-zone coverage map.

## Q2. How do PMs defend estimation logic?
Anchor to drivers: integrations, data readiness, NFRs and governance overhead. Show the assumptions explicitly. Offer options instead of excuses.

## Q3. How should PMs handle mid-sprint scope changes?
Acknowledge the request, quantify impact and present trade-offs. Use CR language and baseline references. Avoid informal approvals by chat.

## Q4. How do PMs communicate risk without sounding defensive?
Describe risk event, likelihood, impact and mitigation. State what support is needed from the client. Track in RAID with owners and dates.

## Q5. How should PMs respond to velocity drops?
Focus on evidence: dependency delays, environment instability or new NFR workloads. Use burn-up and CFD trends. Provide recovery plan across 1–2 sprints.

## Q6. How do PMs manage multi-vendor dependencies?
Define interface ownership explicitly. Establish joint technical forums and escalation paths. Document dependency SLAs.

## Q7. What is a minimal governance cadence?
Weekly delivery review, bi-weekly engagement governance and monthly steering for large programs. Packs should include KPIs, risks and decisions. Keep it consistent and audit-friendly.

## Q8. How should PMs handle UAT delays?
Tie UAT timelines to agreed client responsibilities. Show the impact on go-live and hypercare. Propose phased acceptance where feasible.

## Q9. How do PMs talk about quality gates?
Explain Definition of Done and CI gates in plain terms. Show how gates protect production risk. Align gates to business-critical journeys.

## Q10. How do PMs articulate data migration risk?
Use early profiling results and reconciliation complexity. Propose staged migration and parallel-run when needed. Ask for realistic sample data early.

## Q11. How do PMs handle stakeholder conflict?
Re-anchor to business outcomes and agreed priorities. Use decision logs to prevent re-litigation. Escalate only with structured options.

## Q12. How do PMs answer technical questions without over-claiming?
Explain the high-level pattern and bring the architect for deep dives. Use consistent solution-layer language. Avoid speculative performance numbers.
