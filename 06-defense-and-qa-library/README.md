# Defense & Q&A Library (Legacy Baseline)

This library provides structured, proposal-stage objection handling and enablement narratives used in client-facing presales workshops and internal coaching.

The content is intentionally concise and scenario-driven. It serves as a shared language for project managers, architects, and engineering leads when defending scope, risk, architecture, DevOps posture, and data/security constraints.

## Coverage Map

- 01_Presales_Technical_QA.md  
Core NFR, performance scaling, resilience, security boundaries, auditability, and integration risk posture.

- 02_Commercial_and_Scope_QA.md  
Commercial models, change control, assumption management, pricing levers, and risk-sharing language.

- 03_Architecture_QA.md  
Logical layering, integration contracts, legacy coexistence, and modernization sequencing.

- 04_DevOps_Engineering_QA.md  
CI/CD gates, environment strategy, release governance, SRE-style metrics, and incident hygiene.

- 05_PM_Enablement_QA.md  
English client-facing framing for delivery model, estimation defense, risk articulation, and escalation posture.

Data domain framing, residency constraints, access enforcement patterns, and audit-grade observability.

## Intended Use

- Presales defense preparation for vendor teams.
- PM/tech lead enablement for international client communications.
- Consistency anchor aligned with RFP, estimation, governance, and quality modules.
