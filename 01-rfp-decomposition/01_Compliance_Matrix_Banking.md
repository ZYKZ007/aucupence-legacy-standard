# Regulatory & Compliance Checklist – Retail / SME Banking Transformation

Purpose: internal working matrix to decide Bid / No-Bid, and to prepare defensible, reality-based compliance sections in proposals for retail / SME banking clients. The matrix focuses on *what matters to risk and procurement*, not on ticking theoretical boxes.

## 5. Narrative Blocks for Proposal Text

These fragments are repeatedly reused when writing the “Compliance” and “Regulatory” sections of proposals. They ensure that the written narrative stays consistent with the matrix.

### 5.1 Compensating Controls

When a formal certification is missing but underlying controls are mature, we describe:
- The current control framework and audit cadence,
- Existing internal or customer audits,
- Concrete timelines and milestones towards formal certification.

The objective is to show that the **effective risk level** is equivalent to fully certified peers, even if the paperwork is in transition.

### 5.2 Fronting-Partner Model

When a tender requires a local contracting entity, we describe:
- The local partner’s legal and financial role,
- The subcontracting structure, including flow-down of obligations,
- How governance and accountability remain clear for the end client.

This allows smaller vendors to participate in complex tenders without overstating their legal footprint, while still giving clients a single accountable face.

### 5.3 Data Residency and Cloud

For data-residency requirements, we explicitly:
- Show region-locked data stores,
- Separate PII from non-PII flows,
- Describe encryption, key management and access control around in-region data,
- Clarify which components are multi-region and why (usually anonymised logs or DR replicas).

### 5.4 Operational Resilience

Where regulators focus on operational resilience, we highlight:
- How BCP / DR tests are planned and evidenced,
- How critical suppliers are monitored,
- How exit scenarios are prepared, even if never triggered.

These narratives connect the checklist to a credible, lived-in operating model instead of reading like a generic policy statement.
